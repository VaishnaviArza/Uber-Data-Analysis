# Uber-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes Uber ride bookings to uncover revenue generated, booking details and customer behavior.
Using a dataset of ride bookings, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualizations, and built an interactive dashboard to generate data-driven business insights.

The analysis focuses on ride demand patterns, cancellations, revenue trends, and customer preferences to provide actionable recommendations for improving driver allocation, pricing strategies, and customer experience.
